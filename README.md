With this project, I used mainly used Python, FLask, HTML, BootStrap,CRUD, and SQL.
This project is a Social Network for the company "Shelby Company LTD.", a fictional company from the show Peaky Blinders.
I really enjoyed making this project and I learned a lot! There were speed bumps for sure but I was able to solve every bug that came up with time and a whole lot of effort.
Check it out for yourself!
